# engage

A web app using LAMP stack.The webapp supports student and teacher login.
Before logging in ,one needs to register to the system.Only those users can register already have their details in the database.

To set up:

* Set up LAMP and clone the repo
* Set the environment variables as:
** $DB_SERVER = "localhost"
** $DB_USERNAME = <username>(developed with root as username)
** $DB_PASSWORD = <database password>
** $DB_DBNAME = <mysql database name>
in the configuration files of apache(if not using apache via CLI) or else in the operating system ENV variables.

The student names already there in the database are shown in ***student*** table and the students already registered who can directly login without registering are as shown in ***student_login*** table:
